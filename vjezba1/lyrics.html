            [Verse 1]
            There is a swelling storm
            And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
            And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
            The boy I used to know
            But there is a light in the dark
            And I feel its warmth
            In my hands, in my heart
            But why can't I hold on?

            [Pre-Chorus]
            It comes and goes in waves
            It always does, always does
            We watch as our young hearts fade
            Into the flood, into the flood

            [Chorus]
            And the freedom of falling
            The feeling I thought was set in stone
            It slips through my fingers
            I'm trying hard to let go
            It comes and goes in waves
            It comes and goes in waves
            And carries us away

            [Verse 2]
            Through the wind
            Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
            Memories of a stolen place
            Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

            [Pre-Chorus]
            It comes and goes in waves
            It always does, it always does
            We watch as our young hearts fade
            Into the flood, into the flood

            [Chorus]
            And the freedom of falling
            The feeling I thought was set in stone
            It slips through my fingers
            I'm trying hard to let go
            It comes and goes in waves
            It comes and goes in waves
            And carries us away

            [Bridge]
            I've watched my wild youth
            Disappear in front of my eyes
            Moments of magic and wonder
            It seems so hard to find
            Is it ever coming back again?
            Is it ever coming back again?
            Take me back to the feeling when
            Everything was left to find

            [Pre-Chorus]
            It comes and goes in waves
            It always does, it always does

            [Chorus]
            And the freedom of falling
            The feeling I thought was set in stone
            It slips through my fingers
            I'm trying hard to let go
            It comes and goes in waves
            It comes and goes in waves
            And carries us away

            [Verse 1]
            Slip inside the eye of your mind
            Don't you know you might find
            A better place to play?
            You said that you'd never been
            But all the things that you've seen
            Slowly fade away

            [Pre-Chorus]
            So I start a revolution from my bed
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
            Step outside, summertime's in bloom
            Stand up beside the fireplace
            Take that look from off your face
            You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

            [Chorus]
            And so, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
            Her soul slides away
            But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

            [Verse 2]
            Take me to the place where you go
            Where nobody knows if it's night or day
            Please don't put your life in the hands
            Of a rock 'n' roll band
            Who'll throw it all away

            [Pre-Chorus]
            I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
            'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
            Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
            Stand up beside the fireplace
            Take that look from off your face
            'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

            [Chorus]
            And so, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
            My soul slides away
            But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

            [Guitar Solo]

            [Chorus]
            So, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
            Her soul slides away
            But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

            [Outro]
            So, Sally can wait
            She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
            My soul slides away
            But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger
            I heard you say
            At least not today

            [Verse 1]
            Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
            I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
            And far from flying high in clear blue skies
            I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
            If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
            And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
            And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
            Dial the combination, open the priesthole
            And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)
            
            (Yahoo!)
            
            [Verse 2]
            There's a kid who had a big hallucination
            Making love to girls in magazines
            He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
            Could anybody love him
            Or is it just a crazy dream?
            
            [Verse 3]
            And if I show you my dark side
            Will you still hold me tonight?
            And if I open my heart to you
            And show you my weak side
            What would you do?
            Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
            Would you take the children away
            And leave me alone?
            And smile in reassurance
            As you whisper down the phone?
            Would you send me packing?
            Or would you take me home?
            
            [Verse 4]
            Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
            Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
            I held the blade in trembling hands
            Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
            I never had the nerve to make the final cut
            
            [Outro]
            “Hello? Listen, I think I've got it."
            "Okay, listen, it's a- Hahahaha!”

            Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
            Seamstress for the band
            Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
            You'll marry a music man
            Ballerina, you must've seen her
            Dancing in the sand
            And now she's in me, always with me
            Tiny dancer in my hand

            [Verse 2]
            Jesus freaks out in the street
            Handing tickets out for God
            Turning back, she just laughs
            The boulevard is not that bad
            Piano man, he makes his stand
            In the auditorium
            Looking on, she sings the songs
            The words she knows, the tune she hums

            [Pre-Chorus]
            But, oh, how it feels so real
            Lying here with no one near
            Only you, and you can hear me
            When I say softly, slowly

            [Chorus]
            Hold me closer, tiny dancer
            Count the headlights on the highway
            Lay me down in sheets of linen
            You had a busy day today
            Hold me closer, tiny dancer
            Count the headlights on the highway
            Lay me down in sheets of linen
            You had a busy day today

            [Verse 1]
            Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
            Well, who am I to keep you down?
            It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
            But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Like a heartbeat drives you mad
            In the stillness of remembering what you had
            And what you lost and what you had and what you lost
            
            [Chorus]
            Thunder only happens when it's raining
            Players only love you when they're playing
            Say women they will come and they will go
            When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
            
            [Bridge]
            
            [Verse 2]
            Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
            I keep my visions to myself
            It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
            And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
            Dreams of loneliness
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Like a heartbeat drives you mad
            In the stillness of remembering what you had

            Thunder only happens when it's raining
            Players only love you when they're playing

            When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
            Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
            Players only love you when they're playing
            Say women they will come and they will go
